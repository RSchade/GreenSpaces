				<h3 class="card-title">Summary</h3>
				<p class="card-text">
					This website contains an interactive map exploring the
					possibility of integrating vertical gardens into the Egnatia
					region of Thessaloniki, Greece. Above, the map contains
					many data layers collected from questionnaires as well as
					online sources. Below are a list of sites on the Egnatia
					corridor where vertical garden implementation could take
					place. Spatial analysis and some structural considerations
					were taken into account for this demonstration, but more
					considerations would need to be taken into account before
					actual construction.
				</p>
				<h5 class="card-subtitle">Motivation</h5>
				<p class="card-text">
					Thessaloniki has a shortage of traditional green spaces.
					This can be seen below, the city is compared to
					the World Health Organization (WHO)
					reccommended minimum average green space per person
					along with other major cities. The lack of these spaces 
					can be supplemented with vertical gardens in key areas. 
					This website encapsulates research
					regarding a data driven approach to assessing the
					feasibility of vertical gardens in the Egnatia region. 
					Potential sites were also explored, each pin on the map 
					represents a visited site.
					Click on a site pin for a picture of the location and
					a short description.

				<h5 class="card-subtitle">Data Layers</h5>
				<p class="card-text">
					<b>Relative Green Space:</b> This layer started as a map of
					all building plots from
					<a href="https://gis.thessaloniki.gr/sdi" target="_blank">
						The City of Thessaloniki.
					</a>
					These plots were separated into two categories,
					green spaces and everything else. 
					Every plot then had a set radius
					drawn around it. Every green space that had its center
					point in this circle had its area
					counted towards that plot's total. These totals were then 
					turned into shades of green. White is the lowest
					concentration while bright green is the highest.
					This overlay shows the uneven and low concentration of
					green space in the Egnatia region.
				</p>
				<p class="card-text">
					<b>AirBnB Heatmap:</b> This is a heatmap of AirBnB price
					data in Thessaloniki scraped on the date 11/3/2019. 
					Data was retrieved from
					<a href="http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html" target="_blank">
						Inside Airbnb.
					</a>
					This is included to show the relative concentration
					of tourists as well as suggest the housing prices in the
					city. White regions signify no data, while blue up to
					red regions signify increasing prices of Airbnb listings.
					Zooming in on the map allows seeing the individual
					placement of Airbnb listings.
				</p>
				<p class="card-text">
					<b>Liked and Disliked Regions</b> Among other questions,
					<img style="float: right; padding-left: 1em; width: 50%; max-width: 350px;" 
					 src="graphics/likedislikeregions.jpg"\>
					questionnaire respondents were asked their favorite and
					least favorite regions of Thessaloniki given seven regions
					shown to the side. The brightest color on the overlay
					corresponds to the most people selecting that region.
					This data gives a general idea of which areas in the 
					city need improvement.
				</p>
				<p class="card-text">
					<b>Pedestrian Data:</b> This data layer includes pedestrian
					data along six major axes on the Egnatia Corridor.
					Pedestrian counts were collected by another research group
					in Thessaloniki. Credit to the project "Mapping the
					Complexity and Future Vision of the Egnatia Corridor" by
					Alexander Duffield, Marilyn Galdámez, Hector González and
					Christopher René. Relative pedestrian counts on these axes
					gives context to the relative green space map and Airbnb
					data, high foot traffic areas with little relative
					traditional green spaces would benefit from new
					vertical gardens.
				</p>
				<p class="card-text">
					<b>Prospective Sites:</b> Divided into the categories,
					mixed use, abandoned, hospital, hotel, school, and
					buisiness/government. All of these sites have short
					descriptors and categories with a picture. All of these
					sites have at least one area where a vertical garden
					could be implemented. Four of these sites have more detailed
					analysis below with along with a rough Photoshop mock-up.

					space on the Egnatia, shown on the data layers above. 
					Vertical gardens could be installed on the balconies

					Located in a higher concentration of green space, but still

					The questionnaire was conducted in person and online over

					regarding green spaces and vertical gardens. A sample
					of the questionnaire along with the data collected is
					available at the bottom of the page. What follows is a
